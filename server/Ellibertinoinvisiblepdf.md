One of his most daring exploits was his discovery of a chemical formula that could render him invisible. He used this secret power to spy on his enemies, to escape from danger, and to seduce unsuspecting women. He also wrote a satirical poem called A Satyr Against Mankind, in which he mocked the hypocrisy and folly of human society and praised the wisdom of animals.
 
However, Wilmot's life of pleasure and excess took a toll on his health and his soul. He contracted syphilis and suffered from bouts of depression and remorse. He sought solace in philosophy and religion, and he befriended Gilbert Burnet, a Scottish clergyman who tried to convert him to Christianity. On his deathbed, Wilmot renounced his atheism and his sins, and he asked for forgiveness from God and his wife.
 
El Libertino Invisible is a fascinating portrait of a complex and contradictory man who lived in a turbulent and decadent era. It is also a captivating story of love, lust, power, and freedom that will keep you hooked until the end.
  
El Libertino Invisible is a novel by Max Will, a Swiss graphic artist, industrial designer, architect, sculptor, and painter. Will was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, in 1908, and he studied at the Bauhaus school of art and design in Germany. He was influenced by the principles of functionalism, constructivism, and concrete art. He created works that combined geometric forms, mathematical proportions, and aesthetic harmony.
 
Will was also interested in literature and philosophy, and he wrote several novels and essays. El Libertino Invisible was his first novel, published in 1952. It was inspired by his admiration for John Wilmot, whom he considered a genius and a rebel. He wanted to explore the psychological and moral aspects of Wilmot's life and his use of invisibility as a metaphor for freedom and alienation.
 
El Libertino Invisible was well received by critics and readers, who praised its originality, its style, and its historical accuracy. It was translated into several languages, including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It was also adapted into a film in 1968, directed by Luis BuÃ±uel and starring Jean-Pierre Cassel as Wilmot.
