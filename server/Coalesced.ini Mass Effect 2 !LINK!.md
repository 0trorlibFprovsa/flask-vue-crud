1. **Back up your original Coalesced.ini file.** This is a very important step that will allow you to restore your game to its original state if something goes wrong. To back up your file, simply copy and paste it to another location or rename it to something else (such as Coalesced.ORIGINAL).
2. **Download Notepad++ and install it.** Notepad++ is a free and powerful text editor that supports various formats and encodings. It is essential for editing the Coalesced.ini file because it preserves its structure and encoding. Do not use other text editors such as Wordpad or Notepad as they may corrupt or alter the file. You can download Notepad++ from [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).

4. **Edit the Coalesced.ini file with Notepad++.** Open Notepad++ and then open the Coalesced.ini file with it. You can then search for the section and key-value pair that you want to modify using the Find function (Ctrl+F). For example, if you want to increase the planet rotation speed when scanning, you can search for [SFXGame.SFXGameModeOrbital] and then change ScanPlanetRotationSpeed from 0.25 to 0.50. Be careful not to change the length of the value or add or remove anything from the file as this may cause errors.
