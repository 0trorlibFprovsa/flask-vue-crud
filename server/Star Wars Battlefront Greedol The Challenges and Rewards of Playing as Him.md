## Greedo's Abilities
 
Greedo's abilities are based on his Confidence, which means the more he is in combat, the more powerful his abilities become. His confidence level can be seen on the top of his head when a soldier is assisting or attacking him or above his health bar if you are playing as him. His abilities include:
 
- **Confidence Blast:** The type of grenade varies depending on Greedo's confidence. At the lowest confidence level, Greedo can use a Dioxis Grenade, followed by a Thermal Detonator at confidence 1, then an Impact Grenade at confidence 2, and finally a Thermal Imploder at confidence 3. These grenades can deal massive damage to enemies and objectives, so use them wisely.
- **High Senses:** Greedo's second ability is High Senses, which highlights enemy players through barriers across a large radius, even larger than the Scan Pulse. He laughs if any enemies are highlighted, but won't if he doesn't find anyone. Only he can see the enemies highlighted by this ability, and it will also have a faster cooldown if it doesn't highlight anyone. This ability is useful for finding hidden enemies and planning your attacks.
- **Precision Shots:** With this ability, Greedo marks up to five opponents - and a short timer is activated. Once the timer has counted down he shoots them all with a single blast, firing on them rapidly. This ability will only work in his line of sight, so if a player that is locked on moves behind him, they won't be shot. This ability also won't work if a targeted enemy is behind cover. Also, if the shot doesn't lock onto anyone, it will give a faster cooldown as well. This ability is great for taking out multiple enemies at once or finishing off low-health targets.

## Greedo's Weapon
 
Greedo's weapon of choice is the DT-12 blaster pistol that is also in the Outer Rim DLC. This weapon has high damage and accuracy but low rate of fire and range. It also has a unique hero trait that increases its damage depending on Greedo's confidence level. At level 0, it deals 58-38 damage per shot; at level 1, it deals 75.4-49.4 damage per shot; at level 2, it deals 98.6-64.6 damage per shot; and at level 3, it deals 139.2-91.2 damage per shot. This means that Greedo can kill most enemies with one or two shots at high confidence levels.
 
## Greedo's Strengths and Weaknesses
 
Greedo is a hero that relies on his confidence to deal more damage and use more powerful grenades. This means that he is very effective when he is on a killing spree and has high confidence levels. He can also use his High Senses to spot enemies through walls and his Precision Shots to eliminate multiple targets at once.

However, Greedo also has some drawbacks that make him vulnerable to certain situations. He has low health compared to other heroes (1000) and no defensive abilities or healing options. He also has low mobility and range with his blaster pistol and grenades. This means that he can be easily killed by snipers, explosives, or melee attacks if he is not careful.
