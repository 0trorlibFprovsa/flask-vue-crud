However, the album gained popularity through word-of-mouth and radio airplay, and eventually sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. The album also earned the band several awards and nominations, including a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005.
 
In 2012, Maroon 5 released a 10th anniversary edition of *Songs About Jane*, which included a second disc with demo versions of all the songs, as well as some unreleased tracks and alternate mixes. The anniversary edition gave fans a chance to hear how the songs evolved from their original forms to their final versions.
