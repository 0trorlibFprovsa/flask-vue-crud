# How to Download and Install IGI 2 Trainer for Unlimited Health and Ammo
 
IGI 2: Covert Strike is a popular action game that was released in 2003. The game features a variety of missions that require stealth, strategy, and shooting skills. However, some players may find the game too challenging or frustrating, especially when they run out of health or ammo. Fortunately, there is a way to make the game easier and more fun by using a trainer.
 
A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows the player to activate cheats such as unlimited health, unlimited ammo, no alarms, faster opening doors, and more. A trainer can be downloaded from various websites, such as [gamepressure.com](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=17070) or [igi2trainer.webs.com](https://igi2trainer.webs.com/). The trainer works with version 1.3 of the game, so make sure you have updated your game before using it.

IGI 2: Covert Strike is not just about stealth, though. There are also plenty of opportunities to use various weapons and gadgets to eliminate your enemies. The game features a realistic arsenal of firearms, such as pistols, rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, as well as grenades, mines, and binoculars. You can also use a laptop to hack into security systems, cameras, and doors. The weapons and gadgets are well modeled and sound authentic, but they lack any real impact or feedback. The enemies also don't react convincingly to being shot or blown up, and often die in awkward poses.

The game consists of 19 missions that span across three campaigns: Russia, Libya, and China. Each mission has a set of primary and secondary objectives that you must complete in order to progress. The missions are varied and include tasks such as infiltrating a base, rescuing hostages, sabotaging equipment, stealing documents, and assassinating targets. Some missions also have optional bonus objectives that reward you with extra equipment or information. The missions are fairly large and offer some degree of freedom in how you approach them. You can also save your progress at any time during a mission, which is a welcome improvement over the original game's lack of save feature.
 
However, the missions also suffer from some serious flaws that make them frustrating and repetitive. For one thing, the game's artificial intelligence is very poor and inconsistent. The enemies often act stupidly or unpredictably, sometimes ignoring you completely or spotting you from impossible distances. They also tend to follow scripted paths and routines that make them easy to exploit or avoid. The friendly NPCs are not much better, as they often get stuck or killed by the enemies or by your own actions. The game also has some annoying bugs and glitches that can ruin your experience, such as enemies shooting through walls, objectives not triggering properly, or sounds not playing correctly.
 
Another problem with the missions is that they are often too linear and scripted. Despite the apparent openness of the levels, there is usually only one optimal way to complete them. If you deviate from the intended path or sequence of events, you may encounter invisible walls, locked doors, or unresponsive NPCs that prevent you from progressing. The game also forces you to replay certain sections of the missions if you fail an objective or die, which can be tedious and frustrating. The game's difficulty level is also uneven and unfair at times, as some missions are too easy while others are too hard.
 
IGI 2: Covert Strike also features a multiplayer mode that supports up to 16 players online or over a LAN. The multiplayer mode offers four modes of play: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and cooperative. The multiplayer maps are based on the single-player missions but are modified to suit the different modes. The multiplayer mode is decent enough but nothing remarkable. It suffers from some of the same problems as the single-player mode, such as poor AI, bugs, and glitches. It also lacks any customization options or features that would make it stand out from other online shooters.
 
Overall, IGI 2: Covert Strike is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to its potential. It has some good ideas and elements but they are overshadowed by its many flaws and shortcomings. It might have been acceptable if it had been released in 2000 when the original game came out but it is simply outdated and outclassed by today's standards. IGI 2: Covert Strike is a game that might have been great but instead it makes you feel like you're just going through the motions in a generic shooter.
